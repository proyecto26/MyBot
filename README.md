## Bots History üåé
- 1960: ELIZA
- 1970: PARRY
- 1980: Graphic interface
- 1990: Search engines
- 2000: Social/App stores
- 2010: Bots and agents, human Interaction/Experience

## Chatbots types
- **Utilities:** It fulfills a function for the users and is measured according to the effectiveness of the answers.
- **Social:** Success is measured according to the duration and level of user satisfaction, it is also possible to assess the level of satisfaction through APIs to recognize the level of emotion of users.
- **Assistants (Cortana, Siri, etc):** Acts as a facilitator, usually comes integrated with the Operating System. Main features:
  * Utilities and social capacities
  * Continuous relationship with the user
  * Manage system functions

## Communication flow
List the functions offered by the bot and describe a step by step for its execution:
- Task
- Objective
- Motivation of the user
- Steps
- Forecasts

## Experience components
- Learning and memory
- Perception and sense
- Personality (Intelligence)
- Logic and reason
- Accessibility
- Meaning and tone of text
- Cards
- Images
- Emojis
- Response time
- Conversational branch

## Design
- Inclusive design (Design for all types of public)
- UX (Avatar)
- Character with personality
- Define the devices and channels to support (Cortana, Email, Facebook, etc)
- Form flow (conversation follow-up, validate the data)
- Prevent redirections

## Lifecycle

![Bot Lifecycle](img/bot_lifecycle.png)

# Bot Framework ü§ñ
Open Source Framework to create and connect bots (Cross channel, AI and Up-to-Date resources).
![Bot Framework](img/bot_framework.png)

## Bot Connector Service 
Integrate the bot with different channels as Slack, Skype, Messenger, SMS, etc.
![Bot Connector](img/bot_connector.png)

The **Bot Connector** can connect with the intelligence services and implement other functionalities such as:
- Ability to store the state of the conversation.
- Translate services.
- Telemetry. Information about the service is collected, such as the number of requests, messages that have failed, etc.

## Bot Builder
SDKs for .NET, NodeJS or we can use REST APIs to create and debug bots. It also includes the **Bot Framework Emulator** to test our bots and the Channel Inspector to preview the user experience of our bot on different channels.
Integrate external services and Manage the conversation using [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai/welcome) (Language Understanding Intelligent Service).

- Speaker Recognition
- Speech
- Translator

## Language ü§ù
Allow your apps to process natural language with pre-built scripts, evaluate sentiment and learn how to recognize what users want.

<details>
 <summary>.NET Example</summary>

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class QnADialog : QnAMakerDialog {

  public QnADialog() : 
  base(new QnAMakerService(new QnAMakerAttribute("subscriptionKey", "knowledgeId", "answer not found", 0.5)))
  {
  }

  protected override async Task RespondFromQnAMakerResultAsync(IDialogContext, IMessageActivity message, QnAMakerResult result)
  {
    Activity response = ((Activity)context.Activity).CreateReply();

    var firstAnswer = result.Answers.FirstOrDefault()?.Answer;
    var data = firstAnswer.Split("---");

    if(data.Length == 1) {
      return await context.PostAsync(firstAnswer);
    }

    //Example to get data with a separator
    var title = data[0];
    var description = data[1];
    var url = data[2];
    var image = data[3];

    CustomCard card = new CustomCard 
    { 
      Title = title, SubTitle = description
    };

    card.Buttons = new List<CardAction>
    {
      new CardAction(ActionTypes.OpenUrl, "text", value: url)
    };

    card.Images = new List<CardImage>{
      new CardImage(url = image)
    };

    response.Attachments.Add(card.ToAttachment());

    return await context.PostAsync(response);
  }
}
```
</details>

## Installation

- .NET via Nuget package: `Microsoft.Bot.Builder.CognitiveServices`

## QnA Maker Dialog
Personalization in the response to the user according to the reliability control.

```csharp
[Serializable]
[QnAMaker("subscriptionKey", "knowledgeId", "standard phrase when it doesn't satisfy the minimum response reliability index", 0.5, 1)]
public class QnADialogWithActiveLearning : QnAMakerDialog 
{
}
```

# Channels 
A channel is a connection between Bot Framework and communication applications.

## Publish
- **Skype:**
> A Skype account is required, we can deploy bots to test.
- **Microsoft Teams:**
> An office 365 account is required. We need to enable the permissions to use external apps from the administration panel of Office 365 (Configuration/Services...).
- **Telegram:**
> A Telegram account is required. **BotFather** is an app that we need to install to create and manage our bots, check [here](https://telegram.me/botfather).
- **Web Chat:**
> It's inserted using a HTML Iframe.
- **Slack:**
> It's required to create an app from Slack API, add a new Redirect URL to https://slack.botframework.com and enter the credentials.
